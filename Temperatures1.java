A problem: processing measurement data

Temperature measurements are taken in one and the same place for a couple
of weeks. The measurements are taken regularly ï¿½ the same number of
measurements each week. At the end of the measurement period the collected
data is to be processed: for each week the least, the greatest and the
average temperature is to be determined. The least, greatest and
average temperature for the whole period is also to be computed.

A solution to the problem

This program reads the temperatures and displays them. Then the least,
greatest and average temperature for each week is computed and stored.
These results are printed on the standard output device. Finally, the
least, greatest and average temperature over the whole measurement
period is decided. These results are also printed on the standard
output device.
